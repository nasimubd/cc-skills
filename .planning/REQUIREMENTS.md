## v4.7.0 Requirements — Architecture Hardening + Feature Expansion

### Architecture

- [x] **ARCH-01**: CompanionCore library target extracts all business logic from executable, leaving main.swift as thin shell
- [ ] **ARCH-02**: TTSEngine decomposed into PlaybackManager (AVAudioPlayer lifecycle, pre-buffering)
- [ ] **ARCH-03**: TTSEngine decomposed into WordTimingAligner (MToken-to-word alignment, onset resolution)
- [ ] **ARCH-04**: TTSEngine decomposed into PronunciationProcessor (overrides dictionary, regex preprocessing)
- [ ] **ARCH-05**: TTSEngine becomes thin orchestrator delegating to extracted components
- [ ] **ARCH-06**: All callers updated to use decomposed TTSEngine API (TelegramBot, HTTPControlServer, SubtitleSyncDriver)

### Concurrency

- [ ] **CONC-01**: TTSEngine migrated from @unchecked Sendable + NSLock to Swift actor
- [ ] **CONC-02**: All actor-isolated state mutations happen in synchronous methods (no reentrancy across await)
- [ ] **CONC-03**: Blocking TTS synthesis runs off cooperative thread pool (DispatchQueue bridge or Task.detached)
- [ ] **CONC-04**: Formal Sendable conformance across pipeline components

### Hardening

- [ ] **HARD-01**: Rapid-fire notification handling (5 notifications in 10s without crash or queue corruption)
- [ ] **HARD-02**: Audio hardware disconnect recovery (Bluetooth headphones mid-playback)
- [ ] **HARD-03**: Memory pressure graceful degradation during synthesis
- [ ] **HARD-04**: Concurrent TTS test + real notification race condition eliminated

### Testing

- [x] **TEST-01**: XCTest target for CompanionCore library with SwiftPM `swift test`
- [ ] **TEST-02**: Unit tests for SubtitleChunker (page splitting, line breaks, font sizes)
- [ ] **TEST-03**: Unit tests for WordTimingAligner (MToken alignment, onset resolution, hyphen handling)
- [ ] **TEST-04**: Unit tests for PronunciationProcessor (override matching, regex boundaries)
- [ ] **TEST-05**: Integration tests for streaming pipeline (mock synthesis, verify chunk sequencing)

### Bionic Reading

- [ ] **BION-01**: User can toggle bionic reading mode via SwiftBar settings menu
- [ ] **BION-02**: User can toggle bionic reading mode via HTTP API
- [ ] **BION-03**: Subtitle text renders with bold first 40% of each word when bionic mode enabled
- [ ] **BION-04**: Bionic rendering composes correctly with karaoke gold highlighting

### Caption History

- [ ] **CAPT-01**: User can open scrollable caption history panel showing past captions with timestamps
- [ ] **CAPT-02**: Caption history auto-scrolls to latest, with manual scroll override
- [ ] **CAPT-03**: User can copy individual caption text to clipboard
- [ ] **CAPT-04**: Caption history accessible via SwiftBar button and HTTP API

### Chinese TTS

- [ ] **CJK-01**: CJK text detected via existing LanguageDetector routes to sherpa-onnx engine
- [ ] **CJK-02**: English text continues to use kokoro-ios MLX engine (default)
- [ ] **CJK-03**: sherpa-onnx multilang model loads on-demand (not at startup) to avoid RSS bloat
- [ ] **CJK-04**: Graceful fallback if sherpa-onnx model missing or synthesis fails

### MLX Memory Lifecycle (INSERTED)

- [x] **LEAK-01**: kokoro-ios fork sets Memory.cacheLimit to ≤20MB and calls Memory.clearCache() after each generateAudio() call
- [x] **LEAK-02**: Service exits cleanly after N synthesis sessions with launchd auto-restart completing within 2 seconds
- [x] **LEAK-03**: IOAccelerator (graphics) memory stays under 4GB across 10 consecutive TTS sessions without manual restart

## Future Requirements

### Deferred

- Focus mode / DND integration — no public macOS API, highest risk (deferred from v4.7.0)
- GUI preferences window — SwiftBar + HTTP API is sufficient
- Per-Focus-profile behavior (Work = silent, Personal = audio)

## Out of Scope

- CoreML/FluidAudio TTS — 3.9GB models, overkill (Spike 05)
- Speech recognition / STT — this is a TTS product
- Sidecar iPad display — desktop-native only
- Rewriting SwiftBar in Swift — 244 lines Python, working fine
- Xcode project — SwiftPM only
- CJK karaoke word timing — tokenization is a separate problem, defer to future

### Integration & Reliability

- [x] **REL-01**: Notification deduplication (skip re-notification if transcript hasn't grown)
- [x] **REL-02**: Rate limiting (5s between notification processing)
- [x] **REL-03**: Circuit breaker matches legacy: 3 failures → 5 min cooldown with fallback narrative
- [x] **REL-04**: Stop hook writes notification JSON to correct directory with all required fields
- [x] **REL-05**: Tool breakdown computation (top 6 tools by count, excludes subagent orchestration tools)

### TTS Streaming & Subtitle Chunking
