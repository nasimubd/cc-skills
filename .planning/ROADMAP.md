# Roadmap: claude-tts-companion

<!-- # SSoT-OK -->

## Milestones

- ✅ **v4.5.0 MVP** - Phases 1-10 (shipped)
- ✅ **v4.6.0 Legacy Pipeline Feature Parity** - Phases 11-17 (shipped 2026-03-27)
- 🚧 **v4.7.0 Architecture Hardening + Feature Expansion** - Phases 18-24 (in progress)

## Overview

Replace three separate processes (TypeScript Telegram bot + Python TTS server + Swift subtitle prototype) with a single Swift binary running as a macOS LaunchAgent. The build follows dependency order: foundation first (everything depends on Package.swift), then the two core value props (subtitle overlay, TTS engine), then the bot ecosystem (summaries, core bot, advanced commands), then the event-driven subsystems (file watching, HTTP API), and finally the control surface and deployment (SwiftBar, launchd cutover). Ten phases, each delivering a coherent, testable capability.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

**Goal**: All business logic is testable via `swift test` through a library target extraction
**Depends on**: Phase 17 (existing codebase from v4.6.0)
**Requirements**: ARCH-01, TEST-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. `swift test` runs and passes with at least one unit test for a pure type (e.g., SubtitleChunker or LanguageDetector)
2. `main.swift` is the only file in the executable target -- all business logic lives in CompanionCore library
3. `@testable import CompanionCore` works in the test target without build errors
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md -- CompanionCore library extraction + CompanionApp coordinator + thin main.swift
- [x] 18-02-PLAN.md -- Unit tests for LanguageDetector, SubtitleChunker, TelegramFormatter, TranscriptParser, CircuitBreaker

### Phase 19: TTSEngine Decomposition & Actor Migration

**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: ARCH-02, ARCH-03, ARCH-04, ARCH-05, ARCH-06, CONC-01, CONC-02, CONC-03, CONC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. PlaybackManager owns AVAudioPlayer lifecycle and pre-buffering as a @MainActor-isolated class
2. WordTimingAligner and PronunciationProcessor are pure structs with no mutable state
3. TTSEngine delegates all work to extracted components -- it holds no mutable state and no NSLock
4. All callers (TelegramBot, HTTPControlServer, SubtitleSyncDriver) compile and work against the decomposed API without behavior changes
5. `swift build` produces zero `@unchecked Sendable` warnings for any TTSEngine-related type
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 19-02-PLAN.md -- PlaybackManager @MainActor extraction + TTSEngine actor migration + caller updates

### Phase 20: Unit & Integration Tests

**Goal**: Decomposed components have test coverage that catches regressions before they reach production
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: TEST-02, TEST-03, TEST-04, TEST-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. SubtitleChunker tests verify page splitting, line breaks, and font size variants produce correct output
2. WordTimingAligner tests verify MToken-to-word alignment, onset resolution, and hyphenated word handling
3. PronunciationProcessor tests verify override dictionary matching and regex boundary behavior
4. Integration test verifies a mock synthesis produces correctly sequenced chunks through the streaming pipeline
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 20-01-PLAN.md -- Unit tests for WordTimingAligner, PronunciationProcessor, SentenceSplitter
- [x] 20-02-PLAN.md -- Expanded SubtitleChunker tests + streaming pipeline integration test

### Phase 20.1: MLX Metal Memory Lifecycle

**Goal**: MLX Metal GPU memory is bounded and reclaimed between TTS sessions, preventing IOAccelerator leak from exhausting system RAM
**Depends on**: Phase 18 (CompanionCore for testability)
**Requirements**: LEAK-01, LEAK-02, LEAK-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. kokoro-ios fork sets `Memory.cacheLimit` to <=20MB and calls `Memory.clearCache()` after each `generateAudio()` call
2. Service exits cleanly after N synthesis sessions; launchd auto-restarts within 2 seconds
3. IOAccelerator (graphics) memory stays under 4GB across 10 consecutive TTS sessions without manual restart
4. No regression in audio quality -- batch-then-play pattern preserved, gapless playback confirmed
   **Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 20.1-01-PLAN.md -- kokoro-ios cache reduction + synthesis counter + graceful restart + launchd tuning

**Context**: MLX-Swift creates ~1.7-6GB of unreclaimable IOAccelerator (Metal driver) allocations per synthesis call. Confirmed intentional by design (ml-explore/mlx issue #1086). The static MetalAllocator pools buffers and only frees on process exit. `Memory.clearCache()` manages MLX internal buffer pool but not Metal driver allocations. Process restart is the only 100% reclamation mechanism.

### Phase 21: Pipeline Hardening

**Goal**: The streaming pipeline handles edge cases gracefully without crashes, queue corruption, or resource exhaustion
**Depends on**: Phase 20
**Requirements**: HARD-01, HARD-02, HARD-03, HARD-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Five notifications arriving within 10 seconds are processed without crash or audio queue corruption
2. Disconnecting Bluetooth headphones mid-playback recovers gracefully (audio resumes on default output or subtitle-only fallback)
3. Under simulated memory pressure during synthesis, the binary degrades to subtitle-only mode rather than crashing
4. A TTS test request arriving simultaneously with a real notification does not produce interleaved or corrupted audio
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 21-01-PLAN.md -- TTSPipelineCoordinator: exclusive pipeline access, rapid-fire subtitle-only fallback, concurrent TTS test race elimination
- [x] 21-02-PLAN.md -- Audio route change recovery (AVAudioEngine config change) + memory pressure subtitle-only degradation

### Phase 22: Bionic Reading Mode

**Goal**: Users can toggle a bold-prefix reading mode that makes subtitle text easier to scan at a glance
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: BION-01, BION-02, BION-03, BION-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User can toggle bionic reading on/off from the SwiftBar settings menu
2. User can toggle bionic reading on/off via HTTP API endpoint
3. When enabled, each word in the subtitle renders with bold first ~40% of characters and regular-weight remainder
4. Bionic rendering and karaoke highlighting are mutually exclusive -- enabling one disables the other
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 22-01-PLAN.md -- DisplayMode enum + BionicRenderer + SettingsStore + HTTP API + SubtitlePanel integration + tests
- [x] 22-02-PLAN.md -- SwiftBar Bionic Reading toggle + visual verification checkpoint
      **UI hint**: yes

### Phase 23: Caption History Panel

**Goal**: Users can review and copy past subtitle captions from a scrollable panel
**Depends on**: Phase 18

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User can open a scrollable panel showing past captions with HH:MM timestamps
2. Panel auto-scrolls to the latest caption, but manual scrolling up pauses auto-scroll until user returns to bottom
3. User can click a caption to copy its text to the clipboard as plain text
4. Panel is accessible via both a SwiftBar menu button and an HTTP API endpoint
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

### Phase 24: Chinese TTS Fallback

**Goal**: CJK text is automatically spoken via sherpa-onnx Chinese voice while English continues through the default engine
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: CJK-01, CJK-02, CJK-03, CJK-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Text with >20% CJK characters is synthesized using the sherpa-onnx multilingual engine instead of kokoro-ios MLX
2. English text continues to use the kokoro-ios MLX engine with no behavior change
3. The sherpa-onnx Chinese model loads on first CJK request (not at startup) to avoid RSS bloat
4. If the sherpa-onnx model file is missing or synthesis fails, the system logs a warning and falls back to subtitle-only display
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 24-01-PLAN.md -- CSherpaOnnx C module + SherpaOnnxEngine with on-demand model loading
- [x] 24-02-PLAN.md -- Wire CJK routing into TTSEngine + TelegramBot dispatch + build verification
