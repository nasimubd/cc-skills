# Roadmap: claude-tts-companion

## Overview

Replace three separate processes (TypeScript Telegram bot + Python TTS server + Swift subtitle prototype) with a single Swift binary running as a macOS LaunchAgent. The build follows dependency order: foundation first (everything depends on Package.swift), then the two core value props (subtitle overlay, TTS engine), then the bot ecosystem (summaries, core bot, advanced commands), then the event-driven subsystems (file watching, HTTP API), and finally the control surface and deployment (SwiftBar, launchd cutover). Ten phases, each delivering a coherent, testable capability.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation & Build System** - Package.swift compiles with all dependencies, bridging header works, binary runs
- [ ] **Phase 2: Subtitle Overlay** - Floating karaoke subtitle panel visible on screen with all visual properties
- [ ] **Phase 3: TTS Engine** - Kokoro int8 synthesis produces audio with word-level timestamps
- [ ] **Phase 4: AI Summaries** - MiniMax API generates session narratives with circuit breaker protection
- [ ] **Phase 5: Telegram Bot Core** - Bot connects, handles basic commands, sends session notifications
- [ ] **Phase 6: Telegram Bot Commands** - Bot supports model selection, session resume, CLI subprocess integration
- [ ] **Phase 7: File Watching & Auto-Continue** - Event-driven file monitoring and MiniMax-evaluated auto-continue
- [ ] **Phase 8: HTTP Control API** - External control surface for settings, health, subtitle, and TTS
- [ ] **Phase 9: SwiftBar Integration** - Menu bar plugin controls all subsystems via HTTP API
- [ ] **Phase 10: Deployment & Extras** - Launchd service, rollback, caption history, clipboard, thinking watcher

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation & Build System

**Goal**: The project compiles and runs as a macOS accessory app with all dependencies resolved
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: BUILD-01, BUILD-02, BUILD-03, BUILD-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. `swift build -c release` succeeds with zero errors and produces a single binary under 30MB
2. Package.swift resolves swift-telegram-sdk v4.5.0 and links sherpa-onnx static libraries without conflicts
3. Bridging header imports sherpa-onnx C API and ONNX Runtime C API; a trivial C function call succeeds
4. Binary launches as NSApplication accessory app, logs to stdout, and exits cleanly on SIGTERM
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — SwiftPM scaffold: CSherpaOnnx module map + Package.swift + Config.swift
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — App entry point (main.swift) + plugin registration + build verification

### Phase 2: Subtitle Overlay

**Goal**: Users see floating karaoke subtitles on their macOS screen with all visual and privacy properties
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: SUB-01, SUB-02, SUB-03, SUB-04, SUB-05, SUB-06, SUB-07, SUB-08, SUB-09, SUB-10, SUB-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A floating subtitle panel appears on the MacBook built-in display showing text with dark 30% opacity background
2. Words highlight in warm gold as they are "spoken" (driven by test timings), with past words dimming to silver-grey
3. Panel is invisible to screen sharing, does not steal focus, is click-through, and appears on all Spaces
4. Long text word-wraps to 2 lines without shrinking font size
5. NSAttributedString updates complete in under 1ms per word transition
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — SubtitleStyle constants + SubtitlePanel NSPanel with all window behaviors
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Karaoke highlighting engine + demo mode + main.swift wiring + visual checkpoint
      **UI hint**: yes

### Phase 3: TTS Engine

**Goal**: The binary synthesizes speech from text with word-level timestamps that drive the subtitle overlay
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: TTS-01, TTS-02, TTS-03, TTS-04, TTS-05, TTS-06, TTS-07, TTS-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User hears synthesized speech played through afplay from text input
2. Synthesis runs on a background queue without blocking the subtitle UI
3. Word timestamps extracted from duration tensor drive karaoke highlighting with zero accumulated drift
4. Model loads lazily on first request; peak RSS stays under 700MB during synthesis
5. Synthesis speed is at least 1.5x real-time (no gaps during playback)
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Patch sherpa-onnx for duration tensor + TTSEngine with synthesis/WAV/afplay
- [ ] 03-02-PLAN.md — Word timestamp extraction + karaoke integration + main.swift wiring + verification
      **UI hint**: yes

### Phase 4: AI Summaries

**Goal**: MiniMax API generates session narratives in three formats with failure resilience
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: SUM-01, SUM-02, SUM-03, SUM-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Arc Summary produces a full-session narrative from a JSONL transcript via MiniMax API
2. Tail Brief produces an end-weighted narrative (20% context, 80% final turn)
3. Single-turn summary produces a "you prompted me X ago to..." narrative
4. After 3 consecutive MiniMax failures, summaries disable for 5 minutes (circuit breaker)
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — MiniMax API client & circuit breaker (1/2 SUMMARY)
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Summary prompt templates & orchestrator

### Phase 5: Telegram Bot Core

**Goal**: Bot connects to Telegram, handles basic commands, and sends session notifications with TTS
**Depends on**: Phase 3, Phase 4
**Requirements**: BOT-01, BOT-02, BOT-03, BOT-04, BOT-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Bot connects via long polling and responds to /start, /stop, /status, /health, /sessions, /done, /commands
2. Bot sends session-end notifications containing Arc Summary and Tail Brief
3. Bot dispatches TTS for Tail Brief text with karaoke subtitle overlay
4. Messages use HTML formatting with fence-aware chunking at 4096 char limit
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 05-01-PLAN.md — TelegramFormatter (HTML + fence-aware chunking) + TelegramBot with 7 command handlers
- [ ] 05-02-PLAN.md — Session notification wiring (SummaryEngine + TTSEngine + SubtitlePanel) + main.swift integration

### Phase 6: Telegram Bot Commands

**Goal**: Bot supports model selection, session resume, and Claude CLI subprocess integration
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: BOT-05, BOT-06, BOT-07, CLI-01, CLI-02, CLI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. /prompt command with --haiku, --sonnet, --opus flags spawns Claude CLI with the selected model
2. Claude CLI runs as subprocess via Process + Pipe with CLAUDECODE env var unset
3. Streaming NDJSON response is parsed and forwarded to Telegram as edit-in-place updates
4. Bot resumes existing sessions via Agent SDK subprocess
5. JSONL transcript parsing extracts prompts, responses, and tool counts accurately
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: WATCH-01, WATCH-02, WATCH-03, WATCH-04, AUTO-01, AUTO-02, AUTO-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. New .json files in the notification directory are detected within 100ms and trigger bot notifications
2. JSONL file tailer reads new bytes from growing transcripts via offset tracking
3. DispatchSource watchers persist as strong references (no silent ARC deallocation)
4. Stop hook evaluates session completion via MiniMax and returns CONTINUE/SWEEP/REDIRECT/DONE
