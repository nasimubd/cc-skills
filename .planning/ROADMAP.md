# Roadmap: claude-tts-companion

## Milestones

- 🚧 **v4.5.0 MVP** - Phases 1-10 (in progress)
- 📋 **v4.6.0 Legacy Pipeline Feature Parity** - Phases 11-16 (planned)

## Overview

Replace three separate processes (TypeScript Telegram bot + Python TTS server + Swift subtitle prototype) with a single Swift binary running as a macOS LaunchAgent. The build follows dependency order: foundation first (everything depends on Package.swift), then the two core value props (subtitle overlay, TTS engine), then the bot ecosystem (summaries, core bot, advanced commands), then the event-driven subsystems (file watching, HTTP API), and finally the control surface and deployment (SwiftBar, launchd cutover). Ten phases, each delivering a coherent, testable capability.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

**Requirements**: PROMPT-01, PROMPT-02, PROMPT-03, PROMPT-04, PROMPT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Arc Summary prompt matches legacy verbatim, with turn-by-turn transcript respecting 2000/4000/1500 char budgets per section
2. Tail Brief prompt matches legacy verbatim, with 20% context / 80% final turn weighting applied to transcript input
3. Single-exchange summarizer produces "you prompted me X ago to..." output with ||| delimiter parsing for multi-segment responses
4. Prompts exceeding 800 chars are condensed to under 150 words via MiniMax before display
5. System-injected noise patterns (tool results, environment blocks) are stripped from transcripts before summarization
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md -- Noise filtering and improved turn extraction in TranscriptParser
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md -- Exact legacy prompt templates and prompt condensing in SummaryEngine

### Phase 13: Auto-Continue Evaluation

   **Plans**: TBD

### Phase 15: Telegram Inline Buttons

**Goal**: Notification messages include interactive inline buttons for quick actions
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (notification messages to attach buttons to)
**Requirements**: BTN-01, BTN-02, BTN-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Arc Summary notification includes Focus Tab, Follow Up, and Transcript inline buttons below the message
2. Pressing Focus Tab switches to the iTerm tab where the session ran
3. When a new notification arrives for the same iTerm tab, buttons are removed from the older message (deduplication)
   **Plans**: TBD
   **UI hint**: yes

### Phase 16: Integration & Reliability

**Goal**: The notification pipeline handles edge cases, deduplicates, rate-limits, and fails gracefully matching legacy reliability
**Depends on**: Phase 13 (auto-continue), Phase 14 (TTS dispatch), Phase 15 (buttons)
**Requirements**: REL-01, REL-02, REL-03, REL-04, REL-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Duplicate notifications are skipped when the transcript file has not grown since the last notification for that session
2. Notification processing is rate-limited to at most one every 5 seconds
3. Circuit breaker trips after 3 consecutive MiniMax failures, enters 5-minute cooldown, and uses fallback narrative during cooldown
4. Stop hook writes notification JSON to the correct directory with all required fields (project, session ID, branch, transcript path, duration, turns)
5. Tool breakdown computes top 6 tools by count, excluding subagent orchestration tools (Task, Bash spawning agents)
