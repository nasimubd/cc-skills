# Quick Task 260326-fvh: Deploy claude-tts-companion Summary

**Unified launchd service deployed at ~/.local/bin, replacing telegram-bot + kokoro-tts-server with single binary at 39MB RSS idle**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-26T18:28:44Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-26T18:33:55Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (1 auto + 1 auto-approved checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Deployed claude-tts-companion as unified launchd service (com.terryli.claude-tts-companion)
- Copied Kokoro int8 multi-lang model to canonical path ~/.local/share/kokoro/models/kokoro-int8-multi-lang-v1_0/
- Stopped old telegram-bot and kokoro-tts-server services (plists preserved for rollback)
- Health endpoint verified at localhost:8780/health (status: ok, TTS: ready, subtitle: ready)
- No secrets committed to git

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Populate plist secrets, copy model, build and install** - `f8196055` (chore)
2. **Task 2: Human verification checkpoint** - auto-approved (no commit needed)

## Files Created/Modified

- `plugins/claude-tts-companion/launchd/com.terryli.claude-tts-companion.plist` - Updated Program path from /usr/local/bin to ~/.local/bin
- `plugins/claude-tts-companion/scripts/install.sh` - Updated INSTALL_DIR to ~/.local/bin

## System Changes (not in git)

- Binary installed: `~/.local/bin/claude-tts-companion` (21MB stripped)
- Model copied: `~/.local/share/kokoro/models/kokoro-int8-multi-lang-v1_0/` (109MB)
- Plist installed: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.terryli.claude-tts-companion.plist` (with real secrets)
- Log directory: `~/.local/state/launchd-logs/claude-tts-companion/`
- Service: `com.terryli.claude-tts-companion` running (launchd)
- Stopped: `com.terryli.telegram-bot`, `com.terryli.kokoro-tts-server` (plists preserved)

## Decisions Made

- **~/.local/bin instead of /usr/local/bin**: install.sh originally targeted /usr/local/bin which requires sudo. Changed to ~/.local/bin which is user-writable and already on PATH. Updated both plist Program path and install.sh INSTALL_DIR.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Changed install path from /usr/local/bin to ~/.local/bin**

- **Found during:** Task 1 (install.sh execution)
- **Issue:** `cp` to /usr/local/bin failed with "Permission denied" (root-owned directory, no sudo in sandbox)
- **Fix:** Updated plist Program path and install.sh INSTALL_DIR to ~/.local/bin (user-writable, on PATH)
- **Files modified:** plugins/claude-tts-companion/launchd/com.terryli.claude-tts-companion.plist, plugins/claude-tts-companion/scripts/install.sh
- **Verification:** Binary installed, service running, health endpoint responds
- **Committed in:** f8196055

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** Install path change is purely operational, no functional difference. Binary runs identically from either location.

## Issues Encountered

- **Telegram bot errors on startup**: BotError logs appearing in stderr after service start. Likely caused by Telegram API still holding the long-polling connection from the old telegram-bot service. The bot subsystem reports "unknown" status. Expected to self-resolve as the old connection times out (Telegram long-polling timeout is 30s). Core service health is OK with TTS and subtitle subsystems ready.

## Known Stubs

None -- this is a deployment task, no code stubs created.

## User Setup Required

None -- secrets were populated from ~/.claude/.secrets/ccterrybot-telegram during install and reverted from git.

## Rollback

If issues arise, rollback is available:

```bash
cd plugins/claude-tts-companion && bash scripts/rollback.sh
```

This stops the unified service and re-enables the old telegram-bot + kokoro-tts-server services.
