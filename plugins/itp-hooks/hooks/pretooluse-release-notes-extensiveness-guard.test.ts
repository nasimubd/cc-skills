double-counted the log-range term and inflated realized volatility on wide-range
bars. The fix restores parity with the reference implementation and re-tightens
the entropy skip threshold that had silently drifted over the last several
versions. Operators running the export pipeline should re-baseline their
volatility dashboards, since historical values will shift slightly downward.

- Unify entropy constants (#455)
- Name the entropy skip threshold explicitly (#456)
- Re-baseline exported volatility columns (#457)`;
