# MiniMax Plugin — References Index + Audit Coverage Matrix

Navigable TOC for the deep-dive content. Drill in here when [`../skills/minimax/SKILL.md`](../skills/minimax/SKILL.md) doesn't have the specific endpoint / quirk / failure-mode detail you need.

This file ALSO serves as the campaign's **audit-coverage matrix** — every source-of-truth artifact at `~/own/amonic/minimax/` is tracked here with its aggregation status. The campaign cannot close until every row shows `AGGREGATED` (or `SKIPPED` with explicit rationale). The iter-19 mechanical audit consumes this file's tables.

---

## How to read this index

```
Status legend:
  NOT_AGGREGATED  — source exists; destination not yet written this campaign (default)
  AGGREGATED      — destination file written + content verified against source
  PARTIAL         — destination written but missing sections; tracked in AUDIT.md
  SKIPPED         — deliberately not migrated; reason in Notes column
  STUB            — placeholder file exists for navigation; full content in source-of-truth only
```

## Top-level distilled artifacts

These appear at the SKILL.md primary layer (already auto-discoverable) AND get full-text aggregation in references/.

| Source artifact (read-only)             | Destination                             | Status         | Source iter | Notes                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/own/amonic/minimax/RETROSPECTIVE.md` | `references/RETROSPECTIVE.md`           | AGGREGATED     | iter-42     | DONE iter-5: verbatim copy + 7 cross-ref retargets + provenance note inserted |
| `~/own/amonic/minimax/quirks/CLAUDE.md` | `references/quirks.md`                  | NOT_AGGREGATED | iter-11     | Distilled into SKILL.md decision table; full migration iter-6                 |
| `~/own/amonic/minimax/CLAUDE.md`        | (no destination — distilled only)       | SKIPPED        | iter-1      | Spoke-level pointer; content surfaces via SKILL.md frontmatter                |
| `~/own/amonic/minimax/LOOP_CONTRACT.md` | (no destination — campaign archaeology) | SKIPPED        | n/a         | Source-only campaign state machine; not consumer reference                    |

## Per-endpoint pattern docs (40 source files → `references/api-patterns/`)

Every doc gets a verbatim aggregate copy with internal cross-references retargeted to plugin-relative paths.

## Fixtures (91 source files → selective subset in `references/fixtures/`)

NOT every fixture migrates — bulky ones (long-context probes, code-generation runs) stay source-only. Aggregating only diagnostic / production-decision-relevant fixtures.

### To aggregate

| Source fixture                            | Why aggregate                                              | Status         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| models-list-locked.json                   | OPS tool's data contract — must be in plugin               | NOT_AGGREGATED |
| models-list-2026-04-28.json               | Initial catalog snapshot for diff                          | NOT_AGGREGATED |
| cache-discovery-iter39-2026-04-29.json    | Hybrid cache API discovery evidence                        | NOT_AGGREGATED |

| cache-semantics-iter40-2026-04-29.json    | Threshold + prefix-match + TTL data                        | NOT_AGGREGATED |
| errors-E\*.json (all error scenarios)     | Two-envelope catalogue — production parser depends on this | NOT_AGGREGATED |
| chat-completion-minimal-2026-04-28.json   | Baseline response shape reference                          | NOT_AGGREGATED |
| chat-completion-no-system-2026-04-28.json | Hidden default system prompt evidence                      | NOT_AGGREGATED |

### To skip (source-only — too bulky or marginal)

| Source fixture pattern                            | Skip reason                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `10k-needle-iter32-*.json`                        | ~27K tokens of synthetic 10-K — too bulky  |
| `backtesting-codegen-iter33-*.json`               | 3 generated code variants — derivable      |
| `chat-completion-jsonmode-J*.json` (4 files)      | Pattern is documented; raw not needed      |
| `chat-completion-maxtokens-*.json` (4 sizes)      | Pattern is documented; raw not needed      |
| `chat-completion-stop-*.json` (4 variants)        | Silent-drop pattern is documented          |
| `chat-completion-name-field-N*.json` (3 variants) | Brand-string pattern is documented         |
| Everything else iter-specific                     | Available in source for forensic reference |

## Coverage rollup (computed)

```
Total tracked source artifacts:  ~50 (40 docs + ~8 fixtures + 1 OPS script + 1 plist)
AGGREGATED:                      1  (RETROSPECTIVE.md — iter-5)
NOT_AGGREGATED:                  ~49
PARTIAL:                         0
SKIPPED:                         3  (CLAUDE.md, LOOP_CONTRACT.md, mise task)
STUB:                            0
Last updated:                    iter-5 (2026-04-29 11:18 UTC)
```

**Closure criterion**: AGGREGATED + SKIPPED == total. The campaign cannot close while any row shows NOT_AGGREGATED, PARTIAL, or STUB.

---

## How iters update this matrix

Each Phase B iter (5-15) that aggregates files MUST:

1. Update the affected rows' Status column from NOT_AGGREGATED → AGGREGATED
2. Update the Coverage rollup numbers
3. If any aggregation reveals issues with the source (e.g., broken internal link, contradictory claim), record in [`AUDIT.md`](./AUDIT.md) for cross-reference and bump status to PARTIAL with explanation

The iter-19 mechanical audit consumes this file directly — it parses the tables, walks each Destination column, and confirms the file exists + non-empty. Discrepancies between Status and reality are flagged.
