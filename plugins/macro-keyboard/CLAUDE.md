# macro-keyboard Plugin

> Configure cheap 3-key USB-C/Bluetooth macro pads on macOS via Karabiner-Elements. Covers Fn emission (which BTT / hidutil cannot do), device-scoped remaps that don't touch the MacBook's built-in keyboard, HID diagnostic workflows, and dual-transport (USB + Bluetooth) rules for pads whose BT firmware emits different keycodes than USB.

## Why This Plugin Exists

Generic "remap my keyboard" plugins (Karabiner skills bundled in other marketplaces, QMK/VIA, BTT) all assume flashable firmware or standard well-known HIDs. Cheap Jieli / Realtek / CH57x macro pads from AliExpress:

1. Ship with a fixed HID report descriptor — no QMK/VIA/Vial flashing possible.
2. Emit hardcoded keycode combos (e.g. `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V`) out of the box — wrong if you want Fn or Return.
3. Often have **different VID/PID over Bluetooth** than over USB (and cheap pads borrow Samsung's VID to get macOS-friendly), so a single rule scoped to "USB Jieli" silently stops working when you unplug.
4. Emit modifier+key in **one HID report**, which breaks Karabiner's default sequential `mandatory` matcher and requires `simultaneous` with `detect_key_down_uninterruptedly: true`.
5. **Cannot** emit real Fn from userland via `CGEventPost` — Typeless / macOS dictation keys need a real `kCGEventFlagMaskSecondaryFn` that only DriverKit-backed remappers (Karabiner) can produce.

And once the basics work, a sixth challenge often appears: with only 3 buttons, users want more than 3 actions. The reusable trick here is:

1. **Tap-vs-double-tap discrimination** — coordinate two manipulators via `set_variable` + `to_delayed_action` sharing one `from` trigger. The single-tap target fires after a 200ms detection window expires; the double-tap target fires on the second press (which cancels the pending single-tap). Live examples: the "MacroKeyBot" middle-button Shift+Return/Return pair, and the top-button Fn/Cmd+V pair (added 2026-04-24). Each button needs its own variable name to prevent cross-arming. Full reusable recipe in [`03-patterns.md`](./skills/configure-macro-keyboard/references/03-patterns.md#pattern-tap-vs-double-tap-discrimination-on-one-button) with the safety/speed framing and tuning knob.

All six traps were hit and solved during the live Jieli/Free3-P work captured here. The plugin packages the reusable patterns + a device-specific worked example ("MacroKeyBot").

## Skills

Each skill has its own CLAUDE.md (per-skill SSoT for invariants, edit conventions, and recent-change pointers — read this before editing files inside a skill directory). The SKILL.md is the user-invocable workflow; the CLAUDE.md is the maintainer's compass.

## Worked Example: Jieli/Free3-P 3-Key Pad

The device-specific config lives under `configure-macro-keyboard/references/`:

- **`09-turnkey-walkthrough.md`** — **start here for replication** — copy-paste-ready 30-minute MacroKeyBot recipe for any 3-key pad, with VID/PID placeholders, complete 10-manipulator config (top + middle tap/double-tap pairs across USB + BT), and variation bindings for different use cases
- `overview.md` — TL;DR of device signatures + mapping table
- `01-hardware-identification.md` — VID/PID, HID descriptor decode, chip family inference
- `02-usb-wired-configuration.md` — live USB rule with `simultaneous: [Ctrl, C/V/X]` matchers + tap/double-tap pair on top (Fn / Cmd+V) and middle (Shift+Return / Return) buttons
- `03-patterns.md` — reusable techniques (`simultaneous` vs `mandatory`, `device_if`, Quartz capture, `ignore:true`, tap-vs-double-tap discrimination)
- `04-anti-patterns.md` — dead-ends (BTT `CGEventPost`, hidutil combos, QMK/VIA on Jieli, Touch-ID-triggering audits, tap-vs-hold Fn emission)
- `05-bluetooth-roadmap.md` — historical pre-pairing plan
- `06-bluetooth-landscape-survey.md` — 2026 macro-pad ecosystem survey
- `07-bluetooth-toolbox.md` — tier-ranked FOSS tools for BT control on macOS

- `raw/` — verbatim `lsusb -v`, `system_profiler`, `ioreg`, and Karabiner exports regenerated on change (currently: 10-manipulator live rule)

## Dependencies

| Tool                  | Install                                  | Notes                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Karabiner-Elements    | `brew install --cask karabiner-elements` | Required. DriverKit VirtualHIDDevice is the only userland path to real Fn on macOS. |
| karabiner_cli         | bundled with Karabiner                   | Non-sudo audits of grabbed devices — avoids Touch-ID on TCC.db queries.             |
| blueutil              | `brew install blueutil`                  | BT force-connect + info queries. Not required but strongly recommended.             |
| Karabiner-EventViewer | bundled with Karabiner                   | Live HID event inspection.                                                          |

## Link Conventions

Skill-internal links use relative paths: `[X](./references/X.md)`. Cross-plugin links go through the marketplace root: `[itp](../../itp/CLAUDE.md)`. External links use full URLs.

## Upstream / Downstream

- **Upstream source** (historical evolution): `~/own/amonic/docs/macro-keyboard/` — the working directory on the development laptop where this skill was built live. The amonic spoke now points here as the canonical reference.
- **Downstream**: any future pad (different VID/PID, different keycode firmware) can be added as a new worked example under `configure-macro-keyboard/references/`. Reuse the pattern docs (`03-patterns.md`, `04-anti-patterns.md`) verbatim.
