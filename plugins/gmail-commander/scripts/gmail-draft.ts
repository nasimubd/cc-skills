/**
 * gmail-draft — the CANONICAL Gmail draft builder (create/replace, reply-threaded, wrap-immune).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (regression 2026-07-23): Gmail's drafts API RE-ENCODES ingested raw messages and
 * HARD-FOLDS long text/plain lines at ~72-76 cols — so any draft built from prose (especially prose
 * a markdown formatter hook has wrapped) shows forced mid-paragraph line breaks in the compose
 * window. The cure is structural, not cosmetic: build the draft the way Gmail's own composer does —
 * multipart/alternative with a text/html part (source newlines never render; paragraphs reflow).
 * Enforced by the global PreToolUse guard `../hooks/gmail-draft-guard.sh` (ad-hoc drafts API calls are blocked).
 *
 * USAGE
 *   bun ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/gmail-commander/scripts/gmail-draft.ts \
 *     --account amonic-gmail                  # token base name in ~/.claude/tools/gmail-tokens/
 *     --body /path/to/body.md                 # the body text (markdown-ish; see conversion rules)
 *     --from 'Ricky Chan <rickychanbc@gmail.com>' \
 *     [--reply-to <messageId>]                # thread as a reply to this Gmail message id
 *     [--to a@b] [--cc c@d] [--subject '…']   # required unless --reply-to supplies them
 *     [--replace <draftId>]                   # delete this stale draft after creating the new one
 *
 * BODY CONVERSION (deliberately minimal + predictable, not a full markdown renderer):
 *   - Blank-line-separated blocks become paragraphs; single newlines INSIDE a block are unwrapped
 *     to spaces (this is what defeats formatter-wrapped sources).
 *   - HTML部分: paragraphs → <p>; http(s) URLs auto-linked; everything entity-escaped first.
 *   - text/plain part: the same unwrapped paragraphs (long lines — Gmail may fold THAT part, but
 *     Gmail's editor uses the HTML part, so the visible draft reflows correctly).
 *
 * OUTPUT: one JSON line {draftId, threadId, account} — machine-readable per CLI-first doctrine.

 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST "unwrap every newline" (regression found 2026-07-29)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It used to be. Every blank-line block had its internal newlines replaced with spaces, which is
 * correct and necessary for prose — it is what makes the draft immune to a formatter having
 * hard-wrapped the source. But it silently destroyed every list. A nine-item question checklist,
 * written one item per line, arrived in the recipient's inbox as a single run-on paragraph:
 *
 *     - Q1 - DR. TSANG - Do you want... - Q2 - EITHER - "canine's phase"... - Q3 - EITHER - ...
 *
 * That is worse than ugly. The whole point of that checklist was to let two busy clinicians answer by
 * number without reading the message twice, and collapsing it removed exactly the structure that made
 * it usable. Five separate lists in one clinic email were affected, including the explanation of the
 * five-stage model the message is organised around.
 *
 * THE LEAD-IN CASE, which is the one that is easy to get wrong: a block may begin with a sentence and
 * then continue into a list. Classifying the block by its FIRST line alone would treat the whole thing
 * as prose and fold the items back in. So the block is split at the FIRST line matching the marker
 * pattern: everything before it reflows as prose, everything from it on renders per item. (The
 * notes-commander engine hit precisely this bug on 2026-07-27 and fixed it the same way; the rule is
 * duplicated here rather than shared because these two engines have no common package.)
 *
 * A wrapped continuation line — indented, no marker — is joined back onto its item, so a long item
 * that a formatter wrapped stays one item.

 *
 * An em dash is `e2 80 94`; read as Latin-1 that is exactly `â`, `€`, `"`. Any non-ASCII character
 * hits this — em dash, curly quotes, accented names, CJK.
 *
 * This was NOT a regression of the earlier hard-fold fix. That fix addressed body WRAPPING. Subject
 * encoding is an adjacent surface on the same message that was never covered — which is the more
 * useful lesson: a message has several independently-encoded parts, and fixing one proves nothing
 * about its siblings.
 *
 * Base64 (`B`) rather than quoted-printable (`Q`) because the payload is usually punctuation-dense
 * prose where Q-encoding is barely shorter and far harder to eyeball. Encoded-words are capped at 75

// reach Gmail, preventing wasted API calls and stale drafts.
//
// WHY THIS MATTERS: Layer 1 (read-back verification) catches everything, but costs one API call.
// Layer 2 is cheaper (string parsing only) and prevents bad data from leaving this machine.
// Together, they form a seal on the encoder: if Layer 2 passes, we're safe to send; if Layer 1
// also passes, we're safe to use.
