# gmail-draft-guard — global PreToolUse(Bash) hook: block AD-HOC Gmail drafts-API calls + verify builder health.
#
# THREE INDEPENDENT LAYERS:
#
# LAYER 1 (original, 2026-07-23): Block ad-hoc Gmail drafts-API calls. The canonical builder
# (../scripts/gmail-draft.ts) produces multipart/alternative with text/html (wrap-immune), while
# ad-hoc text/plain drafts get hard-folded by Gmail's ingestion (~72 cols), causing mid-paragraph
# line breaks in the compose window.
#
# LAYER 3 (new, 2026-07-29): Before permitting a draft write via the canonical tool, run the
# builder's test suite and REFUSE if it fails. This prevents shipping a builder whose functions
# have no test coverage (as happened on 2026-07-29 when Subject encoding was never validated).
# Caches the result keyed on builder file mtime so batch operations do not re-run tests each time.
#
# LAYER 1 Fail-open on parse errors (advisory infrastructure must never wedge the session).
# LAYER 3 Fail-closed on test failure or missing test runner (a broken builder is worse than
#         blocking mail, and a missing test runner is likely a misconfiguration worth surfacing).
#
set -euo pipefail

# ── LAYER 3: Test-gate cache and runner ──
#
# Fail-closed on test failure or runner-missing: a builder without passing tests is not to be trusted.
# Cache keyed on mtime so batch operations scale (a typical batch does not rerun tests per draft).
#

GMAIL_DRAFT_TEST_CACHE="${HOME}/.claude/.cache/gmail-draft-builder-test.cache"  # JSON: { fingerprint, result }

# Fingerprint EVERY input that can change the test outcome, not just the builder.
#
# WHY (bug found 2026-07-29 by exercising the gate in both directions): the cache was keyed on
# `gmail-draft.ts`'s mtime alone. Appending a deliberately failing test to gmail-draft.test.ts left
# the builder's mtime untouched, so the gate took a stale "pass" cache hit and PERMITTED the draft
# write. A gate that green-lights a builder whose tests are red is worse than no gate, because it
# reports safety it never checked. The test file, the builder, and every sibling module the suite
# imports are all inputs — so all of them are in the key.

BLOCKED: gmail-draft.ts invoked from a copy that is not the installed marketplace build.

  invoked : (a path other than the canonical one)
  expected: $CANONICAL_TOOL

A source checkout can be many commits behind the installed plugin. On 2026-07-30 one was nine behind
and re-introduced two already-fixed bugs into an email to a dental clinic — welded lists and a
mojibake subject line.

If you are deliberately testing a local build, prefix the command with GMAIL_DRAFT_ADHOC_OK=1.

BLOCKED: ad-hoc Gmail drafts-API write. Use the canonical builder instead:

  bun ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/gmail-commander/scripts/gmail-draft.ts --account <tokenbase> --body <file.md> \
    --from 'Name <addr>' [--reply-to <msgId>] [--to ...] [--cc ...] [--subject ...] [--replace <draftId>]

Why: Gmail re-encodes ingested text/plain and HARD-FOLDS long lines (~72 cols) — ad-hoc drafts show
forced mid-paragraph line breaks in the compose window (regression 2026-07-23). The tool builds
multipart/alternative with a text/html part (wrap-immune) and unwraps formatter-wrapped sources.
Escape hatch (deliberate ad-hoc use): prefix the command with GMAIL_DRAFT_ADHOC_OK=1.

#     bun correspondence/replace-gmail-drafts.ts --execute

# Verified ALLOW by every prior layer. This is not hypothetical and not new: it has now happened
# three times against the same clinic mailbox — `bash /tmp/curve-make-draft.sh` earlier the same day,
# and a Bun script that evening. Both shipped the exact defect Layer 1 exists to prevent (a body
# carrying a formatter's ~100-col hard wrapping, delivered as text/plain and hard-folded again by
# Gmail into forced mid-sentence breaks), and one also shipped a mojibaked Subject.

# never wedge a session. A missed detection costs one bad draft; a wedged shell costs the day.
