  Supervised browser automation of vendor dashboards for operations that have NO public API —
  minting scoped API tokens, creating OAuth apps, flipping account-level toggles. Drives a real
  Chrome over CDP with a persistent per-site profile (human logs in once, supervised; scripts do
  the rest), extracts secrets DOM-to-vault without ever exposing them, and survives UI drift via
  the step-and-shoot method. Use when a task needs a dashboard click-path (Cloudflare token/Zero
  Trust, GitHub OAuth apps, any admin console) and the vendor offers no API or your token lacks
  the scope to grant itself more. Triggers: "no API for this", "create an OAuth app", "mint a
  token in the dashboard", "automate the admin console", "browser-automate the setup".

# dashboard-forge — supervised dashboard automation doctrine

Some operations exist ONLY behind a vendor's web UI (GitHub fine-grained PATs and OAuth apps have
no creation API; a Cloudflare token cannot grant itself new scopes). This skill is the canonical
method for automating those click-paths safely: the human supervises and handles logins/2FA; the
scripts do everything else, reproducibly.

**Harness (SSoT):** [`../../lib/browser-forge.mjs`](../../lib/browser-forge.mjs) — per-site
persistent Chrome profiles + CDP attach + login-wait + identity preflight + consent dismissal +
vault sinks. node ONLY (Bun's `connectOverCDP` times out). Requires `playwright-core` (pinned at
the repo root) and Chrome at the standard macOS path.

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: dashboards drift constantly. When a selector misses or a flow changes,
> fix the forge script AND append the drift note to the Vendor Quirks section below — immediately,
> not later. Only update for real, reproducible breakage.

## The method — step-and-shoot

Write the forge as small, resumable steps against a LONG-LIVED Chrome (launch once; each step
connects, acts, disconnects — `browser.close()` on a CDP connection only detaches, Chrome keeps
running). Never author one monolithic script against an unseen UI.

1. **Launch + human login.** `launchChrome(site, loginUrl)`; the human signs in (incl. 2FA).
   Detect completion with `waitForLogin(ctx, probeUrl, ok)` — poll an authenticated endpoint via
   `ctx.request` with the context cookies. NEVER navigate a visible tab to poll: you would reload
   a half-typed login form.
2. **Identity preflight.** Before ANY mutating step, extract the signed-in identity (a meta tag,
   a settings-page marker, an API echo) and `assertIdentity(actual, expected, resource)`. An
   account-owned resource created under the wrong login is a silent disaster (it happened:
   an OAuth app landed under the wrong GitHub user mid-forge because the human switched accounts).
3. **Act in small steps, screenshot between.** One interaction cluster per step; `shot(page, name)`
   after each. When a locator misses, READ the latest shot, adapt, re-run just that step. Prefer
   role/label-based locators (`getByRole`, description-text anchoring) over CSS classes; for
   checkbox grids, `page.evaluate` walking from a UNIQUE description text up to its row is far
   more drift-proof than nth-child chains.
4. **Expect interceptors.** Cookie/consent overlays (OneTrust & co.) swallow clicks and produce
   pure timeouts with no visible cause — call `dismissConsent(page)` when a click times out
   mysteriously, then retry. GitHub-style sudo/2FA walls mid-flow: pause and let the supervising
   human clear them (or see gh-fine-grained-pat's `autosudo.mjs` for the autonomous passkey path).
5. **Extract secrets DOM-only.** On a token/secret reveal page: `page.evaluate` → match the value
   → `vaultSet(scope, path, value)`. **NEVER screenshot a reveal page** — an agent reading that
   screenshot puts the secret into the conversation context permanently. If a reveal was
   accidentally captured, purge the file AND treat the secret as context-exposed (rotate if the
   transcript leaves the machine).
6. **End-of-run hygiene.** `purgeShots()` (breadcrumbs can show near-secret state), then
   `teardown(site)` — kills the SPECIFIC pid on the CDP port, never `pkill -f` (process-storm
   policy, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).

## Hybrid rule — forge the key, then use the door

Browser-automate the MINIMUM: usually just (a) the login and (b) the one form that mints a
scoped credential. Everything after that goes through the vendor's REAL API with the minted
credential, written as an **idempotent GET-before-POST bootstrap** (see the cf-access-wall skill
for the worked template). UI automation is the crowbar, not the workflow.

## Borrowed-session mode — driving a browser the HUMAN already logged into

A third mode, distinct from launching a per-site profile over CDP. Instead of owning a session,
you **borrow one that is already open** in the operator's own Chrome and drive it via AppleScript:

```applescript
tell application "Google Chrome"
  execute (tab N of window M) javascript "…"
end tell
```

Requires **View → Developer → Allow JavaScript from Apple Events** (persisted per profile as
`browser.allow_javascript_apple_events` in `Preferences` — grep it to check before promising
anything). You then have full DOM read/write with no driver, no profile copy, and no port.

**When it is the RIGHT tool:** the console is behind a passkey / hardware-key / step-up flow that
you must not automate, and a human session already exists. You never touch the credential — you
type inside a door somebody else opened. That distinction is the whole justification, and it is
worth stating out loud in whatever you write afterwards.

**When it is the WRONG tool:** anything unattended, anything needing isolation, anything that
should not be able to see the operator's other tabs. It has no sandbox by construction.

Hard-won rules, each one paid for:

- **Address tabs by URL, never by index.** `activate` and `set index` REORDER windows, so an
  index captured a moment ago can point somewhere else by the time you use it. Re-resolve on
  every call. Make the URL needle specific — `"admin.google.com"` will happily match a different
  admin tab and you will read the wrong page and believe it.
- **Read the JS from a FILE** (`set js to read POSIX file "/tmp/step.js" as «class utf8»`).
  Interpolating JS through bash → osascript → AppleScript string literals mangles quotes and
  backslashes in ways that fail silently or, worse, alter the script.
- **`offsetParent` is null for `position: fixed`,** which is how essentially every Material/modal
  dialog is rendered. A "is it visible" filter built on `offsetParent !== null` therefore hides
  the dialog you are looking for and you conclude the form never opened. Use
  `getBoundingClientRect()` width/height instead.
- **Framework inputs need the NATIVE setter.** Assigning `el.value` updates the DOM but leaves
  Angular/React/Closure's model stale, so the form submits empty. Use
  `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype,'value').set.call(el, v)` then
  dispatch `input` + `change` (+ `blur`). Read the value back and assert it.
- **Verify what is under the point before any coordinate-based click** —
  `document.elementFromPoint(x,y)` and compare to the intended element. In an admin console a
  mis-aimed click is not a failed test, it is an unintended action.
- **Chrome can be RUNNING with zero windows and refuse `open -a`.** `make new window` via Apple
  Events still works. Never quit or restart the operator's browser to "fix" it; you will destroy
  their tabs.

## Secrets discipline (non-negotiable)

- Values ride PIPES: `vault set --stdin <scope> <path>` (SCS vault). Never argv, never stdout,
  never a chat transcript.
- Scripts print LENGTHS and vault paths, not values (`✓ vaulted (len 53)`).
- Profile dirs (`~/.local/share/web-forge/profile-<site>`) hold live sessions — sensitive, never
  committed, listed in backups as credential-equivalent.
- Public identifiers (OAuth client_id, account ids) may be logged; anything CONCEALED may not.

## Vendor quirks (drift log — append, with dates)

- **Cloudflare 2026-07 token UI**: the old template-picker → 3-combobox flow is GONE. "Create
  Token" lands directly on a categorized checkbox form ("Cloudflare One / Zero Trust" section →
  per-group Read/Revoke/Edit boxes); submit is **"Review token"** → "Create token" → modal reveal.
  Tokens are `cfat_…` (53 chars), not the old 40-char format.
- **Cloudflare account-owned tokens** (2026-07-23): `/user/tokens/verify` ALWAYS rejects them
  ("Invalid API Token"); verify with `/accounts/{id}/tokens/verify`. Don't misdiagnose a working
  token as dead.
- **Cloudflare dashboard consent** (2026-07-23): OneTrust overlay appears minutes into a session
  and intercepts pointer events page-wide.
- **GitHub OAuth apps** (2026-07-23): no creation API (same as fine-grained PATs). Form fields:
  `oauth_application[name|url|callback_url]`. "Generate a new client secret" triggers sudo mode;
  a FRESH login usually has a sudo grace window — create the app right after login and the secret
  generation is prompt-free. Client secrets render as a 40-hex blob.
- **Azure Portal — ambiguous accessible names** (2026-08-02): every blade's close button is labelled
  `"Close content '<Blade Title>'"`, so on "Register an application" a fuzzy
  `getByRole("button", {name:/register/i}).first()` matches the CLOSE button, not the submit. It
  clicks, Playwright reports success, the blade shuts and nothing is created. Cost two runs, and the
  second created a DUPLICATE once the truth surfaced. Use `clickExact()` — it refuses on a non-exact
  name and prints the candidate list (verified live: `["Close content 'Register an application'","Register"]`).
- **Azure Portal — two elements match `input[placeholder*="Search"]`** (2026-08-02): the page-wide
  search in the masthead matches BEFORE any blade's own filter. Typing the role name into it left the
  role grid unfiltered, so an exact row lookup found 0 rows and the wizard advanced with no role
  selected. Anchor on the distinctive placeholder (`"Search by role name, description, permission, or ID"`).
- **Azure Portal — a list view can lie about creation** (2026-08-02): after successfully creating an
  app registration as a GUEST (`#EXT#`) user, **App registrations → Owned applications** said "This
  account isn't listed as an owner of any applications in this directory." True (a guest creator is not
  auto-assigned owner) and deeply misleading. Ground truth is the **notifications pane** ("Successfully
  created application X") or the **All applications** tab. Never confirm a mutation from the same
  console's default list view.
- **Azure Portal — tokens are in memory, not localStorage** (2026-08-02): an MSAL SPA of this
  generation keeps ARM/Graph access tokens in memory; a localStorage sweep returns nothing. Capture
  them off the wire with `captureBearer(page, "management.azure.com" | "graph.microsoft.com")`. With an
  ARM token the whole 3-tab role-assignment wizard collapses into one idempotent `PUT` (HTTP 201 first
  try) — the clearest instance of the Hybrid rule in this log.
- **Azure Portal — a cached blade issues no request** (2026-08-02): navigating to a view the SPA has
  already hydrated produces zero traffic, so token capture silently yields `null`, which reads exactly
  like "no permission". `captureBearer` retries with a `reload()` for this reason. The
  App-registrations LIST blade reliably re-queries Graph; the Entra Overview blade often does not.
- **Azure — the Portal and the CLI are DIFFERENT Entra apps** (2026-08-02): portal
  `c44b4083-3bb0-49c1-b47d-974e53cbdf3c`, CLI `04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46`. A Conditional
  Access policy scoped to the CLI (`AADSTS530035`, "Device state: Unregistered") therefore does **not**
  block the portal. This asymmetry is what makes a browser forge the only way in — and note that
  `az account list` then returns `[]`, which is a consequence of the block and **not** evidence that no
  subscription exists.
- **Tailscale — console moved and OAuth clients were renamed** (2026-08-05): `login.tailscale.com`
  redirects to **`console.tailscale.com`**, and `/admin/settings/oauth` redirects to
  **`/admin/settings/trust-credentials`** ("OAuth clients" is now "Trust credentials", created via a
  button labelled just **`Credential`**). Auth keys stayed at `/admin/settings/keys`.
- **Tailscale — Radix checkboxes: the `<input>` is a decoy** (2026-08-05): every scope checkbox
  renders a real `<input type=checkbox>` that is `aria-hidden`, `opacity:0`, **`pointer-events:none`**,
  next to a `<button role="checkbox" data-state="checked|unchecked">` that holds the actual state.
  Clicking the input — even with `{force:true}` — reports success and changes NOTHING; it cost a run
  that looked like it selected six scopes and submitted an empty form. Click
  `button[role=checkbox][id="<scope>"]` and assert via `data-state`. Bonus: **the button ids ARE the
  API scope names** (`auth_keys` = write, `auth_keys:read` = read, `devices:core`, `policy_file`),
  which is the most drift-proof selector on the page — better than the row-title walk.
- **Tailscale — a 50-char cap silently disables the wizard** (2026-08-05): the OAuth/credential
  description is labelled "(optional)" but capped at 50 characters, and exceeding it leaves
  **`Continue` disabled with no inline error** near the button. Symptom is a permanently disabled
  submit; the rule is only visible in body text ("Descriptions can be a maximum of 50 characters").
  When a submit stays disabled, dump the form's body text before suspecting the click.
- **Tailscale — write scopes are gated on tags, so OAuth clients need an ACL change first**
  (2026-08-05): selecting ANY write scope surfaces "Tags (required for write scope)", and tags only
  exist if the tailnet policy file declares them. So an OAuth client (the durable, non-expiring
  credential) cannot be minted in one pass on a tailnet with no tags — it needs a policy-file edit,
  which is a security change the operator should approve. A plain **user-owned auth key** from
  `/admin/settings/keys` has no tag requirement and is the right unblock when the goal is just
  joining one device.
- **Seeding a forge profile from the operator's real Chrome** (2026-08-05): when the per-site profile
  has no session and an interactive login would be the only manual step, copy `Local State` +
  `Default/Cookies` (+ `Default/Network/Cookies` if present) from
  `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome` into a throwaway dir and point
  `WEB_FORGE_PROFILE_DIR` at it. Cookies decrypt because the macOS Keychain key is per-user, not
  per-profile, and no Keychain prompt appears (same Chrome binary). The operator's running Chrome is
  untouched — different `--user-data-dir`. **Delete the seeded dir afterwards**: it holds a copy of
  live session cookies and is credential-equivalent.

- **`shot()` used to report phantom screenshots** (fixed 2026-08-07): it wrapped `page.screenshot`
  in `.catch(() => {})` and returned the intended path regardless, so a failed capture printed a
  confident `[shot] …png` for a file that never existed (caught live — a 30 s font-loading timeout
  on the Lark console, path printed with `existsSync === false`). Screenshots are the only evidence
  a forge has when a selector misses, so a phantom one makes "capture failed" indistinguishable
  from "the page was blank". It now returns `null` and says `FAILED` on both the throw path and the
  resolved-but-no-file path. **Callers must treat `null` as "no evidence", never as a path.**
- **Lark/Feishu developer console — the scope table is VIRTUALIZED** (2026-08-05): `document
.querySelectorAll("tr")` returns **1** and `[role="row"]` returns **0**; rows are
  `div.virtual-table__row` and only ~25 exist in the DOM at once, so scroll-and-scrape silently
  under-reports. Never enumerate it by scrolling — type into the scope filter instead, anchored on
  its distinctive placeholder `input[placeholder^="E.g."]` (the masthead "Search documentation" box
  matches a generic `input[placeholder*="Search"]` FIRST — the same trap as the Azure entry above).
- **Lark console — "More" in Security Settings is a section anchor, not a button** (2026-08-07):
  `getByText("More", {exact:true})` matches exactly one node, and clicking it times out at 10 s with
  no visible cause. Scroll and read the whole page instead of clicking.
- **Feishu docs are JS-gated but expose a markdown twin** (2026-08-07): fetching a doc page yields
  only its title, but the HTML advertises `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">` — append
  `.md` to the doc URL and `curl` returns the full text, Chinese included. The Chinese pages carry
  detail the English ones omit (the app-level "refresh `user_access_token`" switch appears only
  there). Wrong slugs answer `This document is not found`, so probe a few rather than assuming one.

- **Chrome silently ignores `--remote-debugging-port` on the DEFAULT data directory**
  (2026-08-12): Chrome starts normally, the flag appears in `ps`, and the port never binds. The
  only signal is one line on stderr — `DevTools remote debugging requires a non-default data
  directory. Specify this using --user-data-dir.` — which is invisible if stderr goes to a log
  nobody reads. `curl 127.0.0.1:<port>/json/version` then fails with "connection refused" and
  looks like a dead browser rather than a rejected flag. **Diagnose with
  `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -a -p <pid>`**: a Chrome that is up but listening on nothing is
  this, every time. Always pass an explicit `--user-data-dir` alongside the debugging port —
  which the harness already does, and which is exactly why the harness works and ad-hoc
  invocations do not.

- **Google Admin console — the group list lies after a write** (2026-08-12): immediately after
  creating a group, **Directory → Groups** still rendered the empty state, *"Your organization
  doesn't have any groups yet"*, for long enough to read as a failure. The group existed the
  whole time. **This is the SECOND vendor to do this** — see the Azure "a list view can lie about
  creation" entry above — so treat it as a rule rather than a quirk: *never confirm a mutation
  from the same console's default list view.* Confirm from a DIFFERENT system. Here the proof was
  that GCP's `setIamPolicy` **rejects members that do not exist** and accepted the new group, so
  the IAM grant doubled as the existence check.
- **Google Admin console — repeated clicks STACK duplicate dialogs** (2026-08-12): clicking
  "Create group" twice (e.g. once via `.click()`, once via a synthetic pointer sequence when the
  first appeared to do nothing) leaves TWO form instances in the DOM. A later "fill the field with
  this aria-label" then hits an arbitrary one and the visible form stays empty. Reload to a clean
  state before filling, and assert the field count is exactly 1 first.
- **Google Admin console — controls are Closure `div[role=button]` with obfuscated classes**
  (2026-08-12): e.g. `class="U26fgb O0WRkf oG5Srb …"`. Never build a CSS-path selector; match on
  visible text or `aria-label`. Plain `.click()` DOES work on them — if a click appears to do
  nothing, suspect that you are reading the wrong tab before you conclude the click failed.
- **Google Admin console — a preset flips to "Custom" when you narrow a sub-setting**
  (2026-08-12): choosing the `Restricted` access-type preset and then setting "Who can join" to
  *Only invited users* relabels Access type as **Custom**. That is correct and expected, not a
  failed selection. Assert on the SUB-SETTINGS you care about, never on the preset label.
- **Google Admin console — `/ac/groups/new` is not a deep link** (2026-08-12): it answers
  `Error 400 (Bad Request)`. There is no URL that opens the create dialog; you must click through
  from `/ac/groups`.

## Relationship to gh-fine-grained-pat

The PAT skill (gh-tools) is the origin of this harness and keeps its own battle-tested copy +
GitHub-specific machinery (autosudo/webauthn/multi-account). NEW forges build on web-forge's
`lib/browser-forge.mjs`; the PAT skill migrates here only in a deliberate, tested pass — never
casually (anti-fragility: don't destabilize a working credential forge for DRY points).

## Reference implementation

`~/459ecs/curve-dental/scripts/access-bootstrap/` — the 2026-07-23 run that canonicalized this
skill: Cloudflare scoped-token forge + GitHub OAuth-app forge + idempotent Access bootstrap,
end-to-end in one supervised session (decision record: that repo's compliance README §D10).

## Post-Execution Reflection

After this skill completes, check before closing:

1. **Did the dashboard automation succeed?** — If selectors failed or the flow changed, update the forge script and add a drift note to the Vendor Quirks section.
2. **Were secrets stored safely?** — Verify no secrets appear in screenshots, argv, or stdout—only in the SCS vault.
3. **Did the supervised step succeed?** — If the human had to intervene (2FA, sudo, account switch), document the new quirk for future runs.
