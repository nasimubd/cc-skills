/**
 * draft-park.ts — Bun/TypeScript engine for the draft-park skill (notes-commander plugin).
 *
 * Migrated from the standalone draft-hold plugin (2026-07-18) onto the shared notes-core
 * engine, gaining its hardening (skill + engine renamed draft-hold → draft-park 2026-08-12):
 *   • SILENT-FAILURE DETECTION — `new` asserts Notes returned a real note id
 *     (x-coredata://…); on macOS 26 osascript can exit 0 yet create nothing.
 *   • BOUNDED RETRY — transient AppleEvent errors (-600/-1712/"not running") retry with
 *     backoff via runOsa; permission/syntax errors fail fast.
 *   • READ-BACK VERIFY — after `new`, the note is read back and checked for entity leaks
 *     (`&quot` without semicolon) and content presence. `--no-verify` skips.
 *   • The prose-reflow formatter (bodyToHtml) lives in notes-core and is unit-tested there:
 *     prose reflows (blank line = paragraph), lists stay per-item, ``` fences verbatim.
 *
 * Commands (unchanged surface):
 *   draft-park.ts new "<title>" [--session UUID] [--project NAME] [--folder NAME] [--no-verify]
 *   draft-park.ts get "<title>" [--folder NAME] [--body-only]
 *   draft-park.ts list [--folder NAME]
 *   draft-park.ts sticky "<title>" [--folder NAME]

 *
 * It used to be, and on 2026-08-17 that truncated a real clinical message to a real clinic. The author
 * used a six-dash line as a visual divider mid-message; `bodyOnly` stopped there and returned 1,760 of
 * 4,635 characters. Nothing warned anyone — the Notes UI showed the whole message, and the sendable
 * text is only ever inspected by the human who is about to paste it.
 *
 * The severity is not the typo, it is WHOSE TEXT CAN TRIGGER IT. Drafts routinely quote third-party
 * content verbatim — clinician review comments, patient transcripts, Drive comments. So a dash rule
 * written by someone outside this machine could silently cut an outbound message at a point they
 * chose. That makes it an injection, not a formatting bug.
 *
 * TWO SIGNALS, NOT ONE. The footer is `------` followed by a line starting `Parked by Claude Code`.
 * Requiring both means prose dashes are ignored, and searching from the END means a quoted copy of a
 * footer earlier in the body cannot pull the cut point upwards either.

// WhatsApp bold is a SINGLE asterisk. She read a wall of punctuation and asked whether she was even
// looking at the right thing.
//
// The intervention is deliberately CONVERT-AND-WARN rather than refuse. Refusing to park a draft
// containing a heading would make the tool obstructive for the email and iMessage cases, which have
// different rules again; converting silently would hide from the author that their `[label](url)` no
// longer exists as a link. So: rewrite what maps cleanly, and say on stderr what did not — stdout
// stays exactly the sendable text so `--copy` and shell pipelines are unaffected.

 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A REFUSAL AND NOT A WARNING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Notes UI shows a working, clickable link, so the author has every reason to believe the message
 * is fine. The recipient gets an instruction to go and look at something, with nothing to click. This
 * tool exists to stage text a human will SEND; a message that silently loses the thing it is asking
 * someone to open is not a formatting nit.
 *
 * It is caught at `new`, because by `get` the URL no longer exists to recover. The fix for the author
 * is one keystroke — write the URL inline — so refusing costs nothing and removes the failure mode
 * rather than announcing it. `--allow-lossy-links` keeps the door open for a note meant to be READ in
 * Notes rather than sent.
