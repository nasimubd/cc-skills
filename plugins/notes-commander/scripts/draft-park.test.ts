/**
 * draft-park.test.ts — the SENDABLE-TEXT contract.
 *
 * `bodyOnly()` produces the exact string a human pastes into WhatsApp, iMessage or an email. It is the
 * last thing that touches an outbound message and the first thing nobody checks, because the Notes UI
 * shows the whole note while only this function decides what actually gets sent.
 *
 * On 2026-08-17 it truncated a real clinical message to a real clinic: the author used a six-dash line
 * as a visual divider, `bodyOnly` cut there, and 1,760 of 4,635 characters were what a reviewer
 * received. Nothing warned anyone.
 *
 * These tests exist because that defect is INJECTION-SHAPED, not cosmetic. Drafts to this clinic quote
 * third-party text verbatim — clinician review comments, patient transcripts, Drive comments — so the
 * cut point could be chosen by someone who never touched this machine.
