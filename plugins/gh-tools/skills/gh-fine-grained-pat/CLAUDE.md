# gh-fine-grained-pat — maintainer SSoT

Per-skill compass (sibling to [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md)). **Hub**: [gh-tools CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Read this before editing the engine — the GitHub UI is the fragile part and the load-bearing knowledge lives here.

## Why this exists

GitHub has **no API to create fine-grained PATs** (only the web UI). We created one by hand-driven browser automation, hit every gotcha, and codified the result here so it never has to be re-learned. The declarative JSON spec is the SSoT; the engine is a thin, anti-fragile UI driver.

## Runtime invariants (do NOT change blindly)

- **node, never bun.** Bun's `connectOverCDP` times out; node attaches in <1s. All scripts are `.mjs` run with `node`.
- **`--remote-allow-origins=*`** on the Chrome launch — Chrome 111+ rejects the CDP websocket without it.
- **CDP attach** = fetch `http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version` → `webSocketDebuggerUrl` → `chromium.connectOverCDP()` (mirrors `gemini-deep-research/scripts/client.ts`). Retry both steps.
- `playwright-core` resolves from the repo root `node_modules` (pinned `^1.58.2`); scripts just `import { chromium } from "playwright-core"`.
- **Teardown kills a specific PID** found via `lsof -iTCP:<port>`; never `pkill -f` (process-storm policy in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
- **`browser.close()` after each command** disconnects Playwright only — the externally-launched Chrome keeps running (persistent session). Use `pat quit` to actually kill it.

## The four hard-won gotchas (encoded in `form.mjs`)

1. **Generate-confirmation overlay is NOT `role="dialog"`.** After clicking the form's "Generate token", a summary overlay ("New personal access token") appears with its own "Generate token" button portaled to the end of `<body>`. Detection by `role=dialog` fails. Fix: click the **last** visible button whose text is exactly "Generate token" (`generate()`). _This cost two failed attempts originally._
2. **Repo picker intercepts pointer events.** After selecting repos in `#repository-menu-list-dialog`, the dialog stays open and swallows the next click. Fix: close it via `button[aria-label="Close"]` before continuing (`setRepoAccess()`).
3. **"No expiration"** is selectable inline (no immediate modal); its confirmation arrives at the generate-time summary overlay — handled by (1). The inline amber "GitHub strongly recommends…" warning is not a blocker.
4. **Permission access levels.** Newly added permissions default to "Read-only". Each row has an "Access:" button → menu with `menuitemradio` "No access" / "Read-only" / "Read and write". Match the row by its heading prefix, then pick the target level. **Never touch Metadata** (auto-required RO).
5. **Permissions are split across two tabs.** The Permissions section has "Repositories" and "Account" tabs, each with its **own** "Add permissions" menu ("Select repository permissions" / "Select account permissions"). Repository perms (`Contents`, …) are only in the repo menu; account perms (`Gists`, …) only in the account menu. Add + set-level each group while its tab is active (`applyGroup`). _Discovered empirically: searching "Gists" in the repo menu returns "No items available"._
6. **Token-list scrape: capture only the name link.** Each token row has a name link `/settings/personal-access-tokens/<id>` AND a `…/<id>/regenerate?index_page=1` link that shares the id. A naive id-keyed map lets the regenerate link (text "This token has no expiration date") overwrite the name. Fix: match `/\/personal-access-tokens\/(\d+)(?:[?#]|$)/` so only the bare-id href is captured. _This caused a false "cc-skills-release MISSING" sweep on the first run._
7. **Detail-page verification uses friendly nouns, not labels.** A token's detail page renders permissions as prose grouped by access level — e.g. _"Read access to actions, metadata, and repository hooks"_ / _"Read and Write access to code, commit statuses, deployments, and environments"_ — NOT per-label rows. `test/campaign.mjs` parses these clauses and maps UI label → detail noun (below).
8. **GitHub sudo mode ("Confirm access").** On a session that hasn't re-authed recently (e.g. after a Chrome restart), navigating to the new-token page shows a "Confirm access" passkey/2FA challenge instead of the form — `input[name="user_programmatic_access[name]"]` is absent. This cannot be bypassed programmatically. `createToken` → `ensureFormReady()` detects it (page title "Confirm access") and waits up to 3 min for the operator to confirm in the browser (or clears it via the gated passkey when `GH_PAT_AUTONOMOUS=1`), then proceeds.
9. **Passkey enablement invalidates the session ONCE.** Right after the `register` ceremony adds a passkey, GitHub commonly forces a fresh sign-in — the _next_ run lands on the full login page (not just sudo). Re-run `pat login --account <a>` ONE more time; the session then persists across restarts (verified for `vanjobbers`). The ceremony prints this heads-up.
10. **Gists has no Read-only.** GitHub's `Gists` account permission only offers "Read and write" — a spec with `Gists: "read"` fails at `setAccessLevels` ("Read-only not selectable"). Pick the level GitHub actually offers.
11. **Passkey sudo assertion races the virtual authenticator → retry the click.** GitHub's `/sessions/sudo` page auto-fires `navigator.credentials.get()` on load — _before_ `autosudo` mounts its virtual authenticator — so the first attempt shows "Authentication failed" and the button flips "Use passkey" → "Retry passkey". A single post-mount click can still race the authenticator's warm-up. `tryPasskey` therefore **arms the authenticator, then re-clicks the assertion up to 6×** (regex matches both "Use passkey" and "Retry passkey"); a subsequent fresh assertion reliably succeeds. _Empirically: `terrylica` won the race on the first click and looked fine; `vanjobbers` lost it and failed — the retry loop fixes both. The credential itself was valid the whole time (a manual "Retry passkey" with the same stored credential cleared sudo)._

## Live selector map (update when GitHub drifts)

| Step              | Selector / strategy                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name              | `input[name="user_programmatic_access[name]"]`                                             |
| Description       | `textarea[name="user_programmatic_access[description]"]`                                   |
| Expiration open   | `button` name `/days \( \| No expiration \| Custom \| Expiration/i`                        |
| Expiration pick   | exact text "No expiration" / `^<N> days` option                                            |
| Repo access radio | exact text "Public/All repositories" or "Only select repositories"                         |
| Repo picker open  | `button` name `/Select repositories/i`                                                     |
| Repo search       | `input[type="search"]:visible`                                                             |
| Repo option       | exact text `owner/name`                                                                    |
| Repo picker close | `#repository-menu-list-dialog button[aria-label="Close"]`                                  |
| Add permissions   | `button` name `/Add permissions/i`; check via `menuitemcheckbox` name = label              |
| Access level      | row "Access:" button → `menuitemradio` name = level                                        |
| Generate          | `button` name `/^Generate token$/i` (form), then **last** visible "Generate token" (modal) |
| Token value       | `input` whose value starts `github_pat_`                                                   |
| Token list        | `a[href*="/settings/personal-access-tokens/<id>"]` (text = name)                           |
| Account perms tab | `role=tab` name `/Account/i` → its own "Add permissions" menu                              |

## Detail-page noun map (for verification)

The token detail page names permissions with friendly nouns, not the UI labels. `test/campaign.mjs` (`NOUN`) maps them. Verified empirically:

| UI label      | Detail noun     |     | UI label        | Detail noun            |
| ------------- | --------------- | --- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Contents      | `code`          |     | Commit statuses | `commit statuses`      |
| Issues        | `issues`        |     | Deployments     | `deployments`          |
| Pull requests | `pull requests` |     | Environments    | `environments`         |
| Actions       | `actions`       |     | **Webhooks**    | **`repository hooks`** |
| Metadata      | `metadata`      |     | Gists (account) | `gists`                |

Verified for `specs/examples/dependabot-secrets.json`: `Dependabot secrets` → `dependabot secrets`, `Secrets` → `secrets`, `Secret scanning alerts` → `secret scanning alerts`.

When adding a new permission to a spec, confirm its detail noun (create one token, read the detail page) and add it to `NOUN` — otherwise verification reports a false "perm missing".

## Security invariants

- Token value never reaches stdout/chat: `--out` writes 0600; `--vault scope:dot` shells `vault set` (value in-process). `inspect`/`list` never expose the value (the value is not on any later page anyway).
- Persistent profile (`~/.local/share/gh-pat-automation/profile`) holds the GitHub session cookie → sensitive, outside the repo, never committed.

## Recent changes

- **2026-06-26** — skill created. Engine + 5 spec templates + JSON Schema + empirical campaign harness. Codifies the gotchas learned while minting `cc-skills-release`. Empirically validated by create→verify→delete across all 5 specs + a forced-failure case (PASS). The campaign surfaced gotchas 5–7 (two-tab permissions, regenerate-link list scrape, friendly-noun detail page) which are now encoded + documented.
- **2026-06-26 (follow-up)** — added `rotate`, two reminder hooks, `specs/examples/`, and **gotcha #8 (sudo mode)**: `createToken`→`ensureFormReady()` now waits (non-disruptively, no page reload) for the operator to clear GitHub's "Confirm access" challenge. Empirically verified `dependabot-secrets` and extended `NOUN` (dependabot secrets / secrets / secret scanning alerts).
- **2026-06-26 (autonomous web-auth, ADR-driven)** — multi-account autonomous sudo: virtual-authenticator passkey (primary) + password/TOTP fallback, gated `github-web-<account>` blob, session agent for one-tap-per-session, `register`/`agent`/`accounts` verbs + `--account` + `GH_PAT_AUTONOMOUS=1`. Core mechanism proven by `test/webauthn-smoke.mjs` (create→capture→restore) + `test/autonomous.test.mjs` (9 assertions). ADR: `/docs/adr/2026-06-26-autonomous-github-web-auth-virtual-passkey-and-totp-for-pat-engine.md`.
- **2026-06-26 (ceremony + autosudo VALIDATED end-to-end)** — `register` ceremony works: passkey URL is **`/settings/security`** (button "Add passkey"), NOT `/settings/passkeys` (404). Provisioned `terrylica`. After GitHub's server-side sudo window (~3h) expired, an autonomous `create` hit a **real** sudo challenge and `autosudo.mjs` cleared it via the virtual-authenticator passkey (`✓ autonomous sudo (terrylica)` + token created) — the sudo-page selectors worked first try, no refinement needed. One-tap-per-session confirmed (the session agent cached the unlocked blob). The full autonomous path is proven.
- **2026-06-26 (multi-account, per-account profile/port)** — the engine now derives an isolated browser profile (`profile-<account>`) + CDP port from the resolved account, so accounts never collide; the shared/default account (`GH_PAT_SHARED_ACCOUNT`, default `terrylica`) keeps the original `profile` + port 9222. Provisioned a **second** account (`vanjobbers`) end-to-end in its own profile — registry now lists both. **Thoroughly tested vanjobbers**: gated blob intact (passkey+password, no TOTP), session **persists across restarts** (after the one-time passkey-relogin, gotcha #9), and it **minted a real token** in its isolated profile. Surfaced gotchas #9 (passkey-relogin) + #10 (Gists no-read-only).
- **2026-06-27 (passkey assertion race fixed — gotcha #11)** — vanjobbers' autosudo passkey path was exercised against a **real** expired-sudo challenge for the first time and **failed** ("Authentication failed"). Root-caused: NOT a credential problem (a manual "Retry passkey" with the same stored credential cleared sudo and reached the token form). GitHub's `/sessions/sudo` auto-fires the passkey `get()` on load before our virtual authenticator exists, and a single post-mount click raced the warm-up. `tryPasskey` now **re-clicks the assertion up to 6×** ("Use passkey"/"Retry passkey"). terrylica had won the race by luck; this makes both accounts robust. **Re-proven end-to-end (2026-06-28)**: against a genuinely fresh (~34h-expired) sudo challenge, the fixed `create` printed `✓ autonomous sudo (vanjobbers)` and minted a token with one Touch-ID tap and zero manual confirmation — the exact path that failed the day before now passes.
- **2026-06-28 (all 4 personal accounts provisioned + `patch-password` verb)** — provisioned the remaining personal logins **`459ecs`** and **`tainora`** (registry now: 459ecs, tainora, terrylica, vanjobbers; each blob = passkey + password, no TOTP). `eonlabs` needs none — it authenticates AS `terrylica` (org), so org-owned token creation reuses terrylica's passkey. Account set is definitive per the gitconfig `includeIf` SSoT (no hidden accounts). New **`patch-password --account <a>`** verb: re-stores a gated password (passkey **kept** — never re-registers a duplicate passkey) for when the `register` osascript password dialog is missed; idempotent (skips if a password ≥6 chars is already set, `--force` to overwrite, `--totp` to also set a seed). Born from 459ecs's first ceremony missing the password dialog — patched without re-registering. Note: 459ecs/tainora autosudo wasn't yet exercised against a _fresh_ sudo challenge (sudo was valid right after login); identical proven code path, so first expiry will clear with one tap.
- **2026-07-19 (autonomous FULL login on expired session cookie)** — `session()` used to `die("not logged in")` on an expired profile cookie even with `GH_PAT_AUTONOMOUS=1`, so the autonomous machinery never got a chance (found live: expired terrylica cookie during a zz-repo-cleanup token mint). `session()` now, in autonomous mode with a resolved account, navigates to settings (→ GitHub redirects to /login), runs `autonomousSudo` there (the login page's "Sign in with a passkey" button was already covered by `tryPasskey`'s regex), re-checks auth, and only then falls back to the manual `pat login` guidance. Extends ADR 2026-06-26 beyond sudo-only to cold login. Same-mint also exercised the narrow **Administration-RW two-repo delete token** shape end-to-end (create → 2× DELETE /repos → revoke → PID-specific Chrome kill).
- **2026-06-28 (459ecs + tainora autosudo proven end-to-end — all 4 accounts now proven)** — scheduled recheck once their sudo windows expired: both hit a **real** fresh "Confirm access" challenge and `autosudo` cleared it (`✓ autonomous sudo (459ecs)` / `✓ autonomous sudo (tainora)` + token minted, one Touch-ID tap each, zero manual confirmation). The retry-loop fix (gotcha #11) held — neither hit the get()-race; no selector refinement needed. **Autonomous passkey sudo is now proven against fresh challenges for all four accounts (terrylica, vanjobbers, 459ecs, tainora).**
