## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Remove template/example links** - The `./references/guide.md` and `/docs/adr/file.md` links appear to be template examples that should be removed or replaced with actual documentation.

2. **Fix zerotier-network.md reference** - Either:
   - Add the file to the project at `docs/infrastructure/zerotier-network.md`, or
   - Update the link to point to the local file path `~/.claude/docs/infrastructure/zerotier-network.md`, or
   - Remove the reference if it's no longer needed

3. **Fix vale-terminology-enforcement anchor** - Verify the correct section name in `plugins/itp-hooks/CLAUDE.md` and update the link in `docs/CLAUDE.md`

4. **Fix typescript-services-swift-runner--bun---watch anchor** - Verify the correct section name in `plugins/itp-hooks/CLAUDE.md` and update the link in `plugins/tts-telegram-sync/CLAUDE.md`

### Medium Priority

5. **Standardize anchor format** - The `diagnosing-invalid_grant` link uses underscores while markdown processors typically convert spaces to hyphens. Consider updating to `diagnosing-invalid-grant`.

6. **Consider anchor compatibility** - The `development-toolchain` anchors technically work in most markdown viewers despite the space-to-hyphen conversion. This is a low-priority fix.

## Validation Script

A validation script has been created at `/tmp/crew-task8/validate_links.sh` that can be run to re-validate links after fixes are applied.

```bash
/tmp/crew-task8/validate_links.sh
```

---

## Notes

- The validation script uses `realpath` to resolve relative paths correctly
- Anchor detection accounts for case-insensitive matching but may have edge cases with special characters
- External links were not validated for availability
- Directory links (e.g., `./docs/troubleshooting/`) are treated as valid if the directory exists
